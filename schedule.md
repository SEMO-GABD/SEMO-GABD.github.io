This course crams a 16 week semester into 4 weeks. During this time, you will have to complete 11 assignments. Assignments will be released on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The assignments will be due two days later, on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. For example, an assignment given on Monday will be due Wednesday. An assignment given on Friday will be due Sunday.  

Most assignments will take several hours to complete, including reading time and coding time.  Start each assignment as soon as possible so that you have plenty of time to ask questions, solve problems, and complete the assignment before it is due. If you start an assignment too late, you will run out of time.

## Reality Check For You

A regular semester is 15 weeks longs, not counting final exams. During that time, a 3 credit hour course will have 37.5 hours of class time. The university expects two hours of additional work by the student for each hour of class time. That is another 75 hours, for a a total 112.5 hours. The Winter Intersession lasts 26 *days.* Thus, to meet the work requirements for a regular semester, you will need to work an average of 4.3 hours per day.

Be realistic. You have a lot of learning to do in the coming four weeks. Odds are, you will be learning a new skill set in an unfamiliar setting. You will have a lot of exercises to complete that will drill those skills into your fingers and your brain. The exercises will go slowly at first but you will get faster with practice. Do not cheat yourself by copying and pasting. You will not learn the skills and you will start to struggle.

## Reality Check For Me

I have never taught a programming-style course before. I have based this course on similar successful courses but I still lack first-hand experience. I expect glitches; hopefully fewer rather than more. I anticipate most problems will arise early while learning Git and GitHub, as I have never used the Classroom that we are using and you have (probably) never used Git. Once learned, however, we will not have to think again about it. We'll just be able to do it.

I have been and continue to work hard behind the scenes to make this a good course. I expect that you will work hard to get the most from this course. The skills you will learn are real and valued by employers.
