This course crams a 16 week semester into 4 weeks. During this time, you will have to complete 11 assignments. Assignments will be released on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The assignments will be due two days later, on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. For example, an assignment given on Monday will be due Wednesday. An assignment given on Friday will be due Sunday.  

Most assignments will take several hours to complete, including reading time and coding time.  Start each assignment as soon as possible so that you have plenty of time to ask questions, solve problems, and complete the assignment before it is due. If you start an assignment too late, you will run out of time.

Be realistic. You have a lot of learning to do in the coming four weeks. Odds are, you will be learning a new skill set in an unfamiliar setting.
