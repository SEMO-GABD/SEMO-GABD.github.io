This is the course outline and schedule for the 2018-2019 Winter Intersession
course Graphical Analysis of Biological Data (BI 486 / 685).

The official syllabus is on the [course Moodle page.](https://learning.semo.edu)

This course is based on the content of the [original](http://stat545.com) and [current](http://stat545.com/Classroom/) versions of Stat545A offered at the University of British Columbia. This course includes considerable material developed in full or in part by [Dr. Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc). I am grateful to her and all of the other people who developed the original content. I have modified it as necessary to suit the needs of this course.

## About the course

Graphical Analysis of Biological Data will teach you how to

- explore, groom, and visualize data,
- make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable
- use R to accomplish these tasks.

This course is built on and emphasizes [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) to data, analysis, and reproducible results.

**Credits:** 3

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Import, manage, and prepare data for analyses using [R](http://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/); 
- use [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org) to display data using appropriate graphical techniques, such as boxplots, histograms, and Cleveland plots; 
- create reports of reproducible analyses using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com); and
- manage your data and R scripts via the Git version control system.


## Prerequisites

You must have completed BI 283 or have the permission of the instructor.

## Textbook

This course will rely heavily on [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) by [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) and [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/statgarrett) (hereafter, R4ds). The text
is freely available online. R4ds will serve as a tutorial for some readings and a source
of assignment questions. Other open-source resources will be used as needed.


## Assignments and Notes

Assignments will consist of readings from notes provided by the instructor, readings and questions to answer from R4ds, and exercise sets for you to develop and practice your R scripting skills. In some cases, notes and assignments will be provided separately. In other cases, they will be provided together.

You will have three assignments per week. Assignments are due two days after they are assigned (e.g., assignments given on Monday are due on Wednesday) by 23:59. Most assignments will take several hours to complete, including reading and coding time.  Start each assignment as soon as possible so that you have plenty of time to ask questions, solve problems, and complete the assignment before it is due. If you start an assignment too late, you will run out of time.

I will *probably* release each's week's assignments on Sunday. You may work ahead but you may not work behind.weekly batches of 3 overall assignments weekly (batches of 3). For example, a "Wednesday" assignment released on Sunday evening is officially assigned on Wednesday and due on Friday. You can submit it before Friday but not after.

**Warning:** adjustments to this schedule are still being made!

## Expectations

This course crams a 16 week semester into 4 weeks. During this time, you will have to complete 11 assignments.  



## Reality Check For You

A regular semester is 15 weeks longs, not counting final exams. During that time, a 3 credit hour course will have 37.5 hours of class time. The university expects two hours of additional work by the student for each hour of class time. That is another 75 hours, for a a total 112.5 hours. The Winter Intersession lasts 26 *days.* Thus, to meet the work requirements for a regular semester, you will need to work an average of 4.3 hours per day.

Be realistic. You have a lot of learning to do in the coming four weeks. Odds are, you will be learning a new skill set in an unfamiliar setting. You will have a lot of exercises to complete that will drill those skills into your fingers and your brain. The exercises will go slowly at first but you will get faster with practice. Do not cheat yourself by copying and pasting. You will not learn the skills and you will begin to struggle.

## Reality Check For Me

I have never taught a programming-style course before. I have based this course on similar successful courses but I still lack first-hand experience. I expect glitches; hopefully fewer rather than more. I anticipate most problems will arise early while learning Git and GitHub, as I have never used this GitHub Classroom format and you have (probably) never used Git. Once learned, however, we should not have to think again about it. We'll just be able to do it.

I have been and continue to work hard behind the scenes to make this a good course. I expect that you will work hard to get the most from this course. The skills you will learn are real and valued by employers. 

## Evaluation

[(Navigation link to Assignments)](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/)

## Conversation, and Getting Help

Are you stuck? First, try to get unstuck by yourself by following the advice of [stat545.com: help-general](http://stat545.com/help-general.html).

While you are getting started, we recommend you seek help within the STAT545 community first, before, e.g. posting to external forums. We are more cuddly.

The instructor and TAs stand ready to assist you, but your peers will also be a great source of good questions and answers. For that reason, we encourage you to seek help in ways that are visible to others. 

The options are sort of listed in order of preference. But we realize every situation is different and your comfort level with these approaches will change as you learn more.

1. Want to talk about content/coding issues? Post an Issue in the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) (public) repository.
2. Want to talk about the course? Post an Issue in the [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private) repository.
3. Want to talk in person? Come visit us during office hours!
4. Want to privately contact Vincenzo? Feel free to send me an email.
    - I look forward to receiving your email, though I do encourage you to post in one of the `Discussion` repositories unless it's really not appropriate for either platform. 


### Basic Issue workflow

Some advice on opening an Issue on GitHub:

* Give it a specific title.
  - BAD: "aaaaaarrrrrrgh!", "things not working", "i need help"
  - GOOD: 'error when indexing a matrix: "incorrect number of dimensions"'
* Stay specific and be complete-but-concise in the body of the description. Don't expect your helper to play 20 questions with you.
* (Optional) Tag someone: 
	- To get the attention of the teaching team, add the `@2018_teaching_team` tag to notify all five of us.
	- To get the attention of your fellow students, add the `@2018_students` tag to notify them.
* Don't just create Issues -- also respond to them! Think about this in terms of adding to the conversation, not in terms of "correctness". 
* Don't forget to click "Submit new issue"!

Typically, this will trigger an email to the person/team you tagged. The title of your issue will be in the subject line, so I repeat, *make it specific*. Your description will become the body of the email. At the bottom will be a link to the issue on GitHub.

If all goes well, your helper will respond. I almost always do this directly via GitHub, though simply replying to the email basically works. In any case, this back-and-forth will show up as a series of comments on your original issue. It's like an email dialogue but better:

* It's embedded in a relevant Organization/project/repo, so it will be easier to find later vs. digging out of your giant vat of unfiled email.
* It's potentially visible to others (depending on the repo), which could save us from asking/answering the same questions repeatedly.
* The whole discussion will be mirrored via email, so that still serves as a great way to prompt participants to tune in.
* Later you can get fancy and refer to commits and other issues within the repo in slick ways.
  
Once the problem is resolved, the issue can be closed. Note that closed issues remain accessible, in case anyone needs to consult them in the future.

## Annotated Resources

Here are the resources we will be referring to throughout the course, along with a brief description of the resource. 

Overarching resources:

1. <http://stat545.com>
    - As mentioned earlier, this website can be thought of as a textbook for STAT 545/547.
2. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (aka "r4ds"), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
    - STAT 545/547 closely mirrors the topics of this book, making this book more of a true "textbook" for the course.

Resources for more specific topics:

1. [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/), by Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 TA's
    - Great for marrying git, GitHub, R, and RStudio in your workflow.
2. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham
    - If you want to learn more about R as a programming language, this is a very readable and concise way of doing so.
3. [ggplot2 book](http://webcat2.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8489511), by Hadley Wickham
    - Useful for digging deeper into `ggplot2`.
4. [RMarkdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), by Yihui Xie et al.
    - Comprehensive resource for everything R Markdown related.
