### Notes

The markdown commands that you learned in the [previous exercise](week01a.md) can also be used in R to make documents like web (HTML) pages and PDF documents. R Markdown is an enhanced version of markdown with additional features so you can include the results of your analyses. R Studio provides many features that make using R Markdown easy.

For this course, you will use R Notebooks, which create interactive HTML documents. In R Studio, choose `File > New File > R Notebook` from the menu. R Studio creates a new document with example R Markdown text. You will see familiar markdown commands, like `* â€¦ *` for *italics.* 

You probably noticed the YAML Header at the top of the document.

YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language," and is used to set options for making the different types of documents. Many options are available but the default options are suitable for most needs of this course. We might explore additional options, as necessary.

The `title:` option is the one you will change most often, as you should give your document a title that reflects the contents of the document. You shoud also add two other 

### Load the Tidyverse packages.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

View the Anscombe data set.

```{r}
anscombe
```


```{r wrangle}
dat <-
  bind_cols(
    anscombe %>% select(matches("x")) %>% gather(set, "x"),
    anscombe %>% select(matches("y")) %>% gather(key, "y")
  ) %>%
  select(-key) %>% 
  mutate(set = gsub("x", "", set)) %>%  
  as_tibble()


```

Now view the wrangled data set.

```{r}
dat
```



Calculate the mean and standard deviation for x and y of each set.

```{r summarize}
dat %>%
  group_by(set) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_x = mean(x),
    stdev_x = sd(x), 
    mean_y = mean(y),
    stdev_y = sd(y)
    ) 
```
Notice that each set has the same mean and standard deviation for variables *x* and *y*. 


Next, create a graph of each plot.
```{r plot}

dat %>% ggplot(aes(x, y, color = set)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~set, ncol = 2)

```
