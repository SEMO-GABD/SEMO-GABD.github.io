	Abstract = {When invertebrate rhodopsins were used as the outgroup, the rooted phylogenetic tree of 26 vertebrate visual pigments (VPs) was constructed. These VPs are distinguished into the following four clusters: (1) RH1 cluster consisting of rhodopsins, (2) RH2 cluster consisting of VPs with variable ranges of absorption spectra, (3) SWS cluster of short wavelength-sensitive VPs, and (4) LWS/MSW cluster of long and medium wavelength-sensitive VPs. Short wavelength-sensitive VPs from Astyanax fasciatus (AF23), goldfish (BCa), chicken (BGg and VGg), and human (BHs) belong to SWS cluster, whereas that from gecko (BGge) belongs to the RH2 cluster. The SWS cluster is further divided into SWS-I (BHs and VGg) and SWS-II (AF23, BCa, and BGg) groups. The SWS-I group has accumulated more amino acid changes than any other group of VPs. It is suggested that amino acid changes at a few key positions might have been important in the functional differentiation of the SWS-I group from the SWS-II group.},

Despite its importance, the molecular basis of UV vision is not known. Here, we have transformed the zebra finch UV pigment into a violet pigment by incorporating one amino acid change, C84S. By incorporating the reverse mutations, we have also constructed UV pigments from the orthologous violet pigments of the pigeon and chicken. These results and comparative amino acid sequence analyses of the pigments in vertebrates demonstrate that many avian species have achieved their UV vision by S84C.},

	Abstract = {Spectral tuning of visual pigments is typically accomplished through changes in opsin amino acid sequence. Within a given opsin class, changes at a few key sites control wavelength specificity. To investigate known differences in the visual pigment spectral sensitivity of the Lake Malawi cichlids, Metriaclima zebra (368, 488, and 533 nm) and Dimidiochromis compressiceps (447, 536, and 569 nm), we sequenced cone opsin genes from these species as well as Labeotropheus fuelleborni and Oreochromis niloticus. These cichlids have five distinct classes of cone opsin genes, including two unique SWS-2 genes. Comparisons of the inferred amino acid sequences from the five cone opsin genes of M. zebra, D. compressiceps, and L. fuelleborni show the sequences to be nearly identical. Therefore, evolution of key opsin sites cannot explain the differences in visual pigment sensitivities. Real-time PCR demonstrates that different cichlid species express different subsets of the available cone opsin genes. Metriaclima zebra and L. fuelleborni express a complement of genes which give them UV-shifted visual pigments, while D. compressiceps expresses a different set to produce a red-shifted visual system. Thus, variations in cichlid spectral sensitivity have arisen through evolution of gene regulation, rather than through changes in opsin amino acid sequence.},

	Abstract = {Despite the biological importance of UV vision, its molecular bases are not well understood. Here, we present evidence that UV vision in vertebrates is determined by eight specific amino acids in the UV pigments. Amino acid sequence analyses show that contemporary UV pigments inherited their UV sensitivities from the vertebrate ancestor by retaining most of these eight amino acids. In the avian lineage, the ancestral pigment lost UV sensitivity, but some descendants regained it by one amino acid change. Our results also strongly support the hypothesis that UV pigments have an unprotonated Schiff base-linked chromophore.},

	Abstract = {In many vertebrates, UV-sensitive photoreceptors have been identified by microspectrophotometry and UV-visual sensitivity has been identified by behavioral studies, but as yet no vertebrate UV-sensitive pigment gene has been isolated. We have sequenced a cDNA clone that hybridizes to short single cone cells in the zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). These cells, which make up 25% of the cone population in zebrafish retinae, are UV-sensitive (lmax≈360 nm). The visual pigment encoded by this gene is unusual in that its amino acid sequence is more homologous to the rod pigment rhodopsin (up to 89%) than to other cone pigments (35-83%). Like all other vertebrate visual pigments, it contains a lysine residue at position 296, the presumptive retinal binding site, and a glutamate residue at position 113. However, it is unique in possessing a lysine residue at position 126, which may account for the UV-sensitivity of the pigment.},

	Abstract = {A modified structural model of rhodopsin is presented. Seven (a-helical) segments of 24 largely hydrophobic amino acid residues are assembled with exobilayer connecting strands into an aligned set, using the sequences of human red, green, and blue iodopsins (cone pigments) and human and bovine rod rhodopsins. (Aligned set numbering is used in this article.) The inner region of the heptahelical hydrophobic domain includes one His-Glu (Asp) ion pair (red, green rod) near the retinylidene molety in addition to an iminium ion Asp-99 pair. The negative charges posited in the ``point-charge model'' to cause the shift of the retinylidene iminium ion light absorption to longer wavelengths in the protein (``opsin shift'') are Asp-99 (red, green rod), Glu-102 (red, green), und Glu-138 (rod). Blue iodopsin lacks both an ion pair and a counter charge to the iminium ion in the inner region, a fact that explains its absorption relative to rod rhodopsin. The spectroscopic difference between rod rhodopsin and the red/green iodopsins is due to the influence of Glu-102 in the latter. The red-green difference is due to the net effect of seven oH groups around the chromophore, all such groups being found within one helix turn of the retinylidene location. The tryptophan, which rotates as the retinylidene group isomerizes, may be Trp-142 or Trp-177. The geometric change (the rhodopsin ``photoswitch'') resulting from cis-trans isomerization in the first excited electronic state (S1), ultimately leads to RX (photoactivated rhodopsin, metarhodopsin II) and changes the activity of exobilayer groups, possibly causing dissociation of Lys-83 and Arg-85 from the carboxylate groups at positions 263 and 265.},

Living at a depth of about 200 m, the Comoran coelacanth receives only a narrow range of light, at about 480 nm. To detect the entire range of ``color'' at this depth, the coelacanth appears to use only two closely related paralogous RH1 and RH2 visual pigments with the optimum light sensitivities (lmax) at 478 nm and 485 nm, respectively. The lmax values are shifted about 20 nm toward blue compared with those of the corresponding orthologous pigments.

	Abstract = {The main object of this study was to investigate the molecular basis for changes in the spectral sensitivity of the visual pigments of deep-sea fishes. The four teleost species studied, Hoplostethus mediterraneus, Cataetyx laticeps, Gonostoma elongatum and Histiobranchus bathybius, are phylogenetically distant from each other and live at depths ranging from 5OO to almost 5OOO m. A single fragment of the intronless rod opsin gene was PCR- amplified from each fish and sequenced. The wavelength of peak sensitivity for the rod visual pigments of the four deep-sea species varies from 483 nm in H. mediterraneus and G. elongatum to 468 nm in C. Iaticeps. Six amino acids at sites on the inner face of the chromophore-binding pocket formed by the seven transmembrane a-helices are identified as candidates for spectral tuning. Substitutions at these sites involve either a change of charge, or a gain or loss of a hydroxyl group. Two of these, at positions 83 and 292, are consistently substituted in the visual pigments of all four species and are likely to be responsible for the shortwave sensitivity of the pigment. Shifts to wavelengths shorter than 48O nm may involve substitution at one or more of the remaining four sites. None of the modifications found in the derived sequences of these opsins suggest functional adaptations, such as increased content of hydroxyl-bearing or proline residues, to resist denaturation by the elevated hydrostatic pressures of the deep sea. Phylogenetic evidence for the duplication of the rod opsin gene in the Anguilliform lineage is presented.},

	Abstract = {The endemic cottoid fish of Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia offer a singular opportunity for examining within a number of closely related species, the relationships of visual pigments, photoreceptor complements and depth within a deep freshwater environment. The lake, the deepest (16OO m) and one of the largest and most ancient in the world, is unique in that the oxygen levels at the bottom are only reduced to about 8O % of the surface levels. We have studied, by light microscopy, microspectrophotometry and visual pigment extraction, the retinas from 17 species of Baikal cottoids that live at different depths within the lake. Generally the retinas contain, in addition to rods, large green-sensitive double cones and small blue-sensitive single cones: surprisingly for freshwater fish, the visual pigments are based on Vitamin A. The lmax of both rods and cones are displaced to shorter wavelengths vvith increasing depth. Surface species have cones with lmax at about 546,525 and 450 nm and rods at 523 nm, deeper living species retain cones, but with lmax shifting towards 500 and 425 nm and with rods at 480 nm, whereas the deepest living fish possess only rods (lmax 480-500 nm). These data clearly show a correlation between photoreceptor complement, visual pigment lmax and depth, but question the hypothesis that there is a correlation of pigment lmax with water colour since, in contrast to oceanic waters, the maximum transmission of Baikal water is between 550 and 600 nm.},

@article{losey1999aa,
	Abstract = {Ultraviolet-A radiation (320-400nm) is scattered rapidly in water. Despite this fact, UV is present in biologically useful amounts to at least 100m deep in clear aquatic environments. Discovery of UV visual pigments with peak absorption at around 360nm in teleost cone photoreceptors indicates that many teleost fishes may be adapted for vision in the UV range. Considering the characteristic absorption curve for visual pigments, about 18% of the downwelling light that illuminates objects at 30-m depth would be available to UV-sensitive cones. Strong scattering of UV radiation should produce unique imaging conditions as a very bright UV background in the horizontal view and a marked veiling effect that, with distance, obscures an image. Many teleosts have three, or even four, classes of cone cells mediating colour vision in their retina and one can be sensitive to UV. These UV-sensitive cones contain a visual pigment based on a unique opsin which is highly conserved between fish species. Several powerful methods exist for demonstration of UV vision, but all are rather demanding in terms of technique and equipment. Demonstration that the eye lacks UV-blocking compounds that are present in many fish eyes is a simpler method that can indicate the possibility of UV vision. The only experimental evidence for the use of UV vision by fishes is connected to planktivory: detection of UV-opaque objects at close range against a bright UV background is enhanced by the physical properties of UV light. Once present, perhaps for the function of detecting food, UV vision may well be co-opted through natural selection for other functions. Recent discovery that UV vision is critically important for mate choice in some birds and lizards is a strong object lesson for fish ecologists and behaviourists. Other possible functions amount to far more than merely adding a fourth dimension to the visible spectrum. Since UV is scattered so effectively in water, it may be useful for social signalling at short range and reduce the possibility of detection by other, illegitimate, receivers. Since humans are blind to UV light, we may be significantly in error, in many cases, in our attempts to understand and evaluate visual aspects of fish behaviour. A survey of the reflectance properties of skin pigments in fishes reveals a rich array of pigments with reflectance peaks in the UV. For example, the same yellow to our eyes may comprise two perceptually different colours to fish, yellow and UV-yellow. It is clearly necessary for us to anticipate that many fishes may have some form of UV vision.},

	Abstract = {Both residual downwelling sunlight and bioluminescence, which are the two main sources of illumination available in the deep sea, have limited wavebands concentrated around 450-500 nm. Consequently, the wavelengths of maximum absorption (lmax) of the vast majority of deep-sea fish visual pigments also cluster in this part of the spectrum. Three genera of deep-sea loose-jawed dragonfish (Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus), however, in addition to the blue bioluminescence typical of most deep-sea animals, also produce far- red light (maximum emission 4700 nm) from suborbital photophores. All three genera are sensitive in this part of the spectrum, to which all other animals of the deep sea are blind, potentially affording them a private waveband for illuminating prey and for interspecific communication that is immune from detection by predators and prey. Aristostomias and Pachystomias enhance their long-wave visual sensitivity by the possession of at least three visual pigments that are long-wave shifted (lmax values ca. 515, 550 and 590 nm) compared with those of other deep-sea fishes. Malacosteus, on the other hand, although it does possess two of these red-shifted pigments (lmax values ca. 520 and 540 nm), lacks the most long-wave-sensitive pigments found in the other two genera. However, it further enhances its long-wave sensitivity with a chlorophyll-derived photosensitizer within its outer segments. The fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of this pigment are very similar to spectra obtained from mesopelagic copepods, which are an important component of diet of Malacosteus, suggesting a dietary origin for this pigment.},

	Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the UV- blue- and green-sensitive visual pigments of insects were present in the common ancestor of crustaceans and insects, whereas red-sensitive visual pigments evolved later as a result of convergent evolution. This hypothesis is examined with respect to the placement of six opsins from the swallowtail butterfly Papilio glaucus (PglRh1-6) in relationship to 46 other insect, crustacean, and chelicerate opsin sequences. All basal relationships established with maximum parsimony analysis except two are present in the distance and maximum likelihood analyses. In all analyses, the six P. glaucus opsins fall into three well-supported clades, comprised, respectively, of ultraviolet (UV), blue, and long-wavelength (LW) pigments, which appear to predate the radiation of the insects. Lepidopteran green- and red-sensitive visual pigments form a monophyletic clade, which lends support to the hypothesis from comparative physiological studies that red-sensitive visual pigments in insects have paralogous origins. Polymorphic amino acid sites (180, 197, 277, 285, 308), which are essential for generating the spectral diversity among the vertebrate red- and green-sensitive pigments are notably invariant in the Papilio red- and green-sensitive pigments. Other major tuning sites must be sought to explain the spectral diversification among these and other insect visual pigments.},

	Abstract = {1. Interspecific diversity in the visual pigments of stomatopod crustaceans was characterized using microspectrophotometry. We examined the 10 visual pigments in main rhabdoms in retinas of 3 species of each of two genera of stomatopod crustaceans of the superfamily Gonodactyloidea, Gonodactylus (G. oerstedii, C. aloha, and G. curacaoensis) and Odontodactylus (O. scyllarus, O. brevirostris, and O. ``havanensis''). Species were selected to provide a matched diversity of habitats. 	2. In each genus, visual pigments varied in lmax in several regions of the retina, as revealed by analysis of variance. The variation within closely related species of the same genus implies that visual pigments can evolve rapidly in stomatopods. 	3. In photoreceptors of the peripheral retina, which are devoted to spatial vision, visual pigment lmax decreased as the depth range of the various species increased, a typical pattern for marine animals. In contrast, visual pigment lmax in photoreceptors of retinal regions devoted to polarization vision (midband Rows 5 and 6) is not obviously correlated with the spectral environment, implying that polarization information may be confined to particular spectral ranges. Visual pigments of the tiered rows of the midband, which are committed to spectral analysis, span a larger spectral range in shallow-water than deepwater species.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism of spectral tuning in the rhodopsin family of proteins, that act as light-driven proton (ion) pumps and light detectors, has been investigated by a combined ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical technique. Calculations are performed on two members of the family, bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and sensory rhodopsin II (sRII), for which crystal structures of high resolution are available, to explore the physical mechanisms of spectral tuning. Despite a high degree of similarity in the three- dimensional structure, electrostatic environments in bR and sRII differ sufficiently to shift absorption maxima of their common chromophore, a retinal bound to a Iysine via a protonated Schiff base, from 568 nm in bR to 497 nm in sRII. This spectral shift. involving the electronical ground state (S0) and first excited state (S1) of retinal, is predicted correctly within 10 nm. The spectral shift can be attributed predominantly to a change in polarization of the S1 state, and is induced predominantly by a shift of the G helix that renders the distance between the Schiff base nitrogen of retinal and the Asp201 counterion shorter in sRII than in bR. A second, weakly allowed excited state, S2, is predicted to lie energetically close to S1, at 474 nm. Its energetic proximity to the S1 state suggests strong vibronic coupling and explains a shoulder observed at 457 nm in the sRII spectrum.},

	Abstract = {ales of two closely related, co-occurring species of Lycaena butterflies have dorsally blue (Lycaena heteronea) or red-orange plus ultraviolet (Lycaena rubidus) wings. Males are selectively territorial against conspecific males. Virgin females accept only conspecific males, probably chosen by wing color. Females are nonterritorial and spend most of their adult activity ovipositing on the correct larval food plants. Eyes of both species contain four spectral types of visual pigments (P360, P437, P500, and P568) but the distribution of these pigments within the receptor mosaic is quite different between both species and sexes. The ventral eye region of L. heteronea is tetrachromatic but that of L. rubidus is trichromatic, lacking the blue-sensitive visual pigment P437. The dorsal eye region of males of both species is dichromatic (P360 and P437). Visual-pigment spectra and wing-reflectance spectra are well matched for effective discrimination of wings of conspecific males from those of other species. The dorsal region of female eyes is trichromatic, containing P360, P437, and P568. The third visual pigment, P568, is important for long-range detection by ovipositing females of red coloration on Eriogonum and Rumex food plants. P568 has the same absorbance spectrum as the human red-cone and is considerably red-shifted compared to the P530 possessed by most insects. That the sexes and closely related species can have such major differences in distribution of visual pigments indicates that the visual system is as readily altered as wing coloration in the course of adaptive evolution.},

@article{weitz1993aa,
	Abstract = {We have studied the metarhodopsin I (M l)-metarhodopsin II (M II) equilibria of expressed wild-type and mutant rhodopsins. We studied two classes of mutants with amino acid substitutions in or near the putative transmembrane segments: those in which a charged residue was replaced by a neutral residue (or in one case another charged residue) and those in which a neutral residue likely (or postulated) to be in proximity to the retinylidene Schiff's base was replaced by a charged residue. In the first class, we found mutants that abnormaily favored M II (replacements of Asp-83, Glu-134, or Arg-135) as well as one that abnormally favored M I (replacement of Glu-122). In the second class, we found several mutants that abnormally favored M I, the most extreme being those in which glutamate replaced His-211 or Ala-292. These studies suggest that electrostatic forces play a major role in the energetics of the M l-to-M II transition, and they indicate that electrostatic perturbation in the vicinity of the protonated retinylidene Schiff's base is a plausible mechanism for the change in its pKa that is associated with the M l-M II transition. They further suggest that the highly conserved pair of charged residues homologous to Glu- 134 and Arg-135 may play a general role in agonist-dependent conformational changes in G-protein-coupled receptors.},

@article{kakitani1999aa,
	Abstract = {We investigated the molecular mechanism of a rather large red shift of 31 nm in a human red pigment compared with a human green pigment. ln this analysis, we paid special attention to the phenomenon of nonadditivity of spectral shifts due to substitution of the key amino acids (OH-bearing amino acids) and the phenomenon of cooperativity by which the spectral shifts due to substitution of the key amino acids in the protein environment of red pigment are about 1.5 times larger than that in the protein environment of green pigment. The analysis was made by using a model of three active sites on which the key amino acids are located and four effective sites by which the effect of the key amino acids is modified. As a result, we found that the interaction between the active sites that occurs through the repolarization of the chromophore induced by the key amino acid is essential for the nonadditivity phenomenon. We also found that the interaction between the active site and the effective site plays a major role in the cooperativity phenomenon. More directly, we say that the highly polarizable property of the chromophore is the origin of the rather large red shift in red pigment. Based on these analyses, we conclude that the interaction between the polarizable chromophore and the protein moiety has the capability of producing a significant spectral shift, at least 1000 cm-1, even by substitution of moderate polar residues of the OH-bearing amino acids.},

	Abstract = {The absorption maximum of the retinal chromophore in color visual pigments is tuned by interactions with the protein (opsin) to which it is bound. Recent advances in the expression of rhodopsin-like transmembrane receptors and in spectroscopic techniques have allowed us to measure resonance Raman vibrational spectra of the retinal chromophore in recombinant visual pigments to examine the molecular basis of this spectral tuning. The dominant physical mechanism responsible for the opsin shift in color vision is the interaction of dipolar amino acid residues with the ground- and excited-state charge distributions of the chromophore.},

@article{yan1995aa,
	Abstract = {The basis for wavelength regulation in bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and retinylidene proteins in general has been studied for decades but is still only partially understood. Here we report the preparation and spectroscopic characterization of BR analogs aimed at investigating the existence of spectral tuning mechanisms other than the two widely accepted mechanisms, weakened counterion interactions and ring/chain coplanarization. We synthesized two novel retinal analogs containing a saturated 13-14 bond, which interrupts the interaction of the protein counterions with the chromophore conjugation system. Furthermore, one of the analogs has a planar polyene system so that the contribution to the red shift of BR by retinal ring/chain coplanarization is also absent. We incorporated these analogs into bacterhodopsin and discovered a sizable amount of red shift, which can be accounted for by interactions between the polar or polarizable groups of the protein and the retinal polyene chain. Our results suggest that the wavelength regulation in BR is achieved by synergistic chromophore/protein interactions including ring/chain coplanarization, excited state stabilization by polar or polarizable protein side chains located along the polyene chain, and weakened counterion interactions near the Schiff base positive charge.},

@article{cowing2002aa,
	Abstract = {The cottoid fishes of Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of visual pigments in a group of closely related species exposed to different photic environments. Members of this species flock are adapted to different depth habitats down to >1000 m, and both the rod and cone visual pigments display short wave shifts as depth increases. The blue-sensitive cone pigments of the SWS2 class cluster into two species groups with l max values of 450 and 430 nm, with the pigment in Cottus gobio , a cottoid fish native to Britain, forming a third group with a l max of 467 nm. The sequences of the SWS2 opsin gene from C. gobio and from two representatives of the 450 and 430 nm Baikal groups are presented. Approximately 6 nm of the spectral difference between C. gobio and the 450 nm Baikal group can be ascribed to the presence of a porphyropsin/rhodopin mixture in C. gobio. Subsequent analysis of amino acid substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that the remainder of the shift from 461 to 450 nm arises from a Thr269Ala substitution and the shift from 450 to 430 nm at least partly from Thr118Ala and Thr118Gly substitutions. The underlying adaptive significance of these substitutions in terms of spectral tuning and signal-to-noise ratio is discussed.},
