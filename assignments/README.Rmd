Assignments will be posted here as they are made available. 

(Information about the peer review can now be found on the [peer review page](peer-review.html).)

## Logistics

Here is the general flow that will happen for the assignments.

1.  When an assignment is released, I will post a GitHub Issue in [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal), tagging the teaching team and students (you should get an email notification, too, unless you've somehow disabled this, are not `Watch`ing the Discussion-Internal repo, or did not inform me of your GitHub username).
2.  You will be prompted to create a repository through GitHub Classroom. Develop your homework responses on this repository, which will be contained in the [STAT545-UBC-students](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students) Organization.
3.  Upon completion, it would be useful for you to submit a link to your URL in the UBC Canvas page. We will be putting your grades there.

## Evaluation

Components of each assignment will be graded on a 3-point scale. Here is the general rubric (*also consult any specific guidance given in the relevant assignment itself*).

Topic| Excellent: 3 | Satisfactory: 2 | Needs work: 1 |
|----| ------ |-------| -----|
|Coding style| Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable|
|Coding strategy| Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors  | Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some "hacking" instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors. |   Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors. |
|Presentation: graphs | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point | Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels. | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions. |
|Presentation: tables | Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features. | Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.| Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.|
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.|Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.|Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.|
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work|Access as easy as possible, code runs! | Satisfactory | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions  and/or code does not run|



The grade mapping is as follows:

| Grade | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| 0 | 0% | 
| 1 | 50% | 
| 2 | 80% | 
| 3 | 100% |

Intermediate points are allowed, and follow a linear scale in between each point, so that the full mapping is depicted in the following chart:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(c(0,1,2,3), c(0, 50, 80, 100), geom=c("point", "line")) +
    theme_bw() +
    scale_y_continuous("Percent grade", limits=c(0,100), breaks=0:5*20) +
    xlab("Integer grade")
```
