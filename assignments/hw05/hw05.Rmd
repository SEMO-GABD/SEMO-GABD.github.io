By the end of this assignment, you should be able to achieve the following tasks in R:

- use R notebooks and R markdown;
- insert, write, and evaluate code chucks; 
- produce plots with `ggplot2`, including boxplots, scatterplots, and line graphs; and
- confidently stage, commit, and push with Git.

*These achievements belong to Learning Outcomes 4, 5, 6.*

You will make 10 plots for this assignment, using the skills you developed in the previous homework. 

**Note:** If you contact me for help or (better yet) open an issue in the [public discussion forum,](https://github.com/SEMO-GABD/public_discussion) please include the code that is not working and also tell me what you have tried.

## Preparation

- Open your `.Rproj` project file in RStudio.

- Create an `hw05` folder inside the same folder as your project file.

- Review [R4ds Chapter 3: Data Visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) as necessary to make the plots described below.

## Graph some biological data

- Create a new R Notebook called `<lastname>_hw05.Rmd` and save it in your `hw05` folder.

- Copy and paste the YAML header from HW04 and replace the default header in your new document. Change the title as appopriate.

- Load the `tidyverse` package in your first code chunk.  

Develop this habit for the remaining assignments: Open your Rproj file, download or create your new notebook as assigned, edit the YAML file, and then insert your first code chunk where you will load any packages needed for the assignment.

***

For this homework, you will use `ggplot2` to make plots from some of the datasets that come with R and the `tidyverse` packages. I will give you the dataset to use, and other information to use for mapping, etc. I expect you will write and execute the code.

- The first time you use a dataset, load it with the command `data(dataset name)` in your code chunk. For example, `data(faithful)` loads the Old Faithful dataset. Technically, you do not have to do this but it is good coding practice. **I expect that you will do this.**

- After you load the dataset, and only for the first time, enter `?<dataset name>` in your code chunk to see the format of the data. For example, `?faithful` will give you information about the Old Faithful dataset.

    **Note:** You should *always* inspect your data visually. That is why I am telling you to do this step.
    
    You only need to do these two steps the first time you use a dataset.

- Run each code chunk, and write 1-2 sentences that describes any trends or patterns that you observe in the plot. In other words, think like a scientist!

- Include the `#### Plot <no.>` header above each plot. 

#### Plot 1

- Plot type: scatterplot
- Dataset: trees
- x-axis: height
- y-axis: girth

```{r}
ggplot(data = trees) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Height, 
                 y = Girth))
```


#### Plot 2

Apply some of your skills that you learned during Assignment 02.  You will make two vectors, then combine them into a data frame for plotting. Review the assignments if necessary.

- Make a vector called `year` for 1821 to 1934. Rememeber how to use `:` to make a sequence of numbers?

- Look at the `class()` of the `lynx` dataset. The `lynx` dataset is a "time series" class (`ts`). You can convert the time series data to a vector by using the `as.vector()` function. Just put the dataset name inside the parentheses. Assign this to the variable `pelts`.

- Make a dataframe called `lynx_pelts` from these two vectors.

- Plot type: linegraph
- Dataset: lynx_pelts (see above)
- x-axis: year
- y-axis: pelts
- Make the line color maroon. Maroon is one of the default R colors.


```{r}
year <- 1821:1934
pelts <- as.vector(lynx)
lynx_pelts <- data.frame(pelts, year)

ggplot(data = lynx_pelts) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, 
                y = pelts), 
            color = "maroon")
```


#### Plot 3

- Plot type: scatterplot
- Dataset: iris
- x-axis: petal length
- y-axis: petal width
- Point color and shape by species. You do not have to use fillable shapes.
- Point size of 2
- Add a `labs` layer to change the x- and y-axis labels so that they do not have periods in the names (i.e., `Petal Length`, `Petal Width`).

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Petal.Length, 
                 y = Petal.Width, 
                 color = Species,
                 shape = Species),
             size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Petal Length",
       y = "Petal Width")
```

#### Plots 4 and 5

- This requires two code chunks, which will be nearly identical

- Plot type: Violin plot (look up `geom_violin`)
- Dataset: msleep
- x-axis: vore
- y-axis: sleep_rem
- fill = grayXX where XX is either 30 or 70.
- In your description, describe in your own words what violin plots display (you can search the interwebs), and what is the difference among the two versions of gray shading. *Hint:* the grays extend from `gray0` to `gray100`. You can learn more about colors in R from [this PDF file.](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = vore, 
                  y = sleep_rem),
              fill = "gray70")
```

#### Plot 6

There is no plot 6. And, [there is no spoon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXtO5dMqEI)

#### Plot 7

- Plot type: boxplot
- Dataset: msleep
- x-axis: order
- y-axis: sleep_total
- use `coord_flip()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = order, 
                   y = sleep_total)) +
  coord_flip()

```


#### Plot 8

- Plot type: boxplot with points
- Dataset: msleep
- x-axis: conservation
- y-axis: awake
- You must have a boxplot layer, a point layer, and a jitter layer.
- color by conservation status.
- You *may* use `coord_flip` but it is not required. Try both and choose the one you think looks best.
- Add a `lab` layer to change both axis labels so each starts with an upper-case letter.
- Search the internet to find out how to change the legend title to `Conservation`. Make that change. (Do not try to change the actual legend entries like "cd" and "vu"). **Note:** This can be done a couple of different ways but `scale_color_discrete()` is one good way.


```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep,
       aes(x = conservation, 
           y = awake, 
           color = conservation)) +
  geom_point()  +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(x = "Conservation",
       y = "Awake") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Conservation")
```

#### Plots 9 and 10.

- Make two scatterplots of your choice, with the following constraints. 

- One should plot any one of the "sleep" or "awake" variables against body weight. The other should plot any one of the "sleep" or "awake" variables against brain weight.
- In each plot, color the points by one of the nominal data categories. Use a different category for each plot. 
- Apply `facet_wrap()` to at least one of the plots using one of the nominal variables. You decide whether you use 2 or 3 columns. *Hint:* use one of the nominal variables with relatively few different types for wrapping. *Explore:* What happens if you use a nominal variable like `genus`, with lots of types?
- You should try a few versions of each graph until you find combinations that you think show some clear trends. 
- Describe the patterns or trends you see in each graph.
